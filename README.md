# hackatron

## Overview
This is a fork copy of my nwHacks project!

Hackatron is our rendition of the retro game, Pacman. This project was developed as our submission for nwHacks 2016.

## Accomplishments
Within 24 hours, our team was able to:
- remake on the popular game using phaser.io engine
- implement a multiplayer game using web technology & frameworks such as `socket.io` & `node.js`, which was new to the entire team.
- integrate an AI using a pathfinding library.

## What We Learned
1. JavaScript & Node.js framework
2. Understand basic communication between client-side and server-side networks
3. How to stay awake for 24+ hours
